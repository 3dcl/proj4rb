=Proj4rb

This is a ruby binding for the Proj.4 Carthographic Projection library (http://proj.maptools.org), that supports conversions between a very large number of geographic coordinate systems and datums.

==Operations
The library can be loaded this way:
	require 'proj4'
The classes are in the Proj4 module:
	include Proj4	
Currently, the binding gives you 2 classes: <tt>UV</tt> and <tt>Projection</tt>. To create a projection, you would do the following:
	proj = Projection.new(["proj=utm","zone=21","units=m"])
This defines a UTM21 North projection in WGS84. Note that the <tt>proj.exe</tt> initialization arguments equivalent to the one above would be:
	+proj=utm +zone=21 +units=m
Then to use the projection, you have 2 operations: +forward+ and +inverse+. +forward+ transforms the UV in WGS84 lon/lat (in radians) to the coordinate system defined during the creation of the Projection object. +inverse+ does the opposite. For example:
	projected_uv = proj.forward(lonlat_uv)
	lonlat_uv = proj.inverse(projected_uv)
A UV object has 2 properties: +u+ and +v+, which can be set and retrieved.

You are also given 2 constants to convert between degrees and radians: +DEG_TO_RAD+ and +RAD_TO_DEG+
 
For now that is all there is to the Proj4rb library. Feel free to suggest additionnal functionnalities.
